This is unuseable source code that can be used as a tutorial/refresher for JavaScript and any related Libraries, APIs, etc. Again, the code provided is not intended for actual use and any errors as a result of running it is as expected. This code is solely meant to be examined for learning purposes. Essentially, it is a means to take notes on a variety of sources that I view to gather more information.
